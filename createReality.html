<p>Create Reality is a showcase of performance and visual art in Virtual Reality worlds. Created by local artists and performers Ashanti Harris, Natasha Ruwona and Purina Alpha in tandem with digital crafters Niall Lavigne and Libby Odai.  During the performance we will take you on a guided tour of their otherworldly  digital realms. </p>
<br>
<h4>Natasha Ruwona - dwelling on a sanctuary</h4>
<p>dwelling on a sanctuary is an underwater sensorial experience grounded in speculation about underwater worlds.  It is informed by research into Drexciya, the Zimbabwean water spirit (Njuzu) and traditional healer (N’anga).  The Njuzu are said to pull their subjects underwater, returning them to dry land equipped with the healing powers of a N’anga.  The work places the viewer into this world to explore it’s objects and writings and consider methods towards healing through the body. </p>
<h4>Ashanti Harris - Black Gold: The Masquerade</h4>
<p>On the 20th May 2015, Exxonmobil - one of the world's largest international oil and gas companies - announced the discovery of oil in Guyana. On the 15th March 2019, Georgetown, the capital city of Guyana, was twinned with Aberdeen. From the violence of colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade, to the industrial mining of minerals extracted from the land, to oil production offshore, Black Gold explores the complex relationships between Guyana and Scotland alongside Guyana’s long relationship with violent forms of extraction.

Using an autobiographical approach, Black Gold is a visual, kinaesthetic and sonic procession into the centre of the Earth. You are invited to join the masquerade and move through layers of thoughts, memories, oral histories, field recordings and choreographic directions, travelling backwards to a place of Black Gold.</p>
<h4>Purina Alpha - Jinhwa</h4>
<p>Jinhwa (meaning ‘evolution’) is a very personal work that I am so excited to have the chance to create.  It will last around 20 minutes in total (or just under), and will consist of 4 parts.  It documents my own evolution, like a dance autobiography.  My artistic practice is divisible into drag and dance, so this will be reflected in the work: each part will have a lipsync performance as well as a dance section.  Each part of the work will incorporate a different dance style: contemporary, vogue choreography, African and hiphop.  Some of the songs are in Korean, and the lyrics of these I will be translating myself as part of the project.  The looks in the project range from simple minimalist makeup to full drag looks.  I am also very pleased to be collaborating with other creatives that are close friends, who each were integral in the personal journey the show is about, and now are on board to be in the performance.  I also feel this is one of the first works that reflects my current stage in my artistic development, so I thought it fitting that it be a very personal one.  I’m looking forward to showing everyone what I’ve been working on!</p>
